This is a partial demo meant to run on google colabs (import the ipynb files). To run properly, you'll want to create a folder on Google Drive called "GD API" and put the excel file there.

This is really rough, more work TBD (likely refactoring this into a standalone python library that can be imported into colabs with less boilerplate).
